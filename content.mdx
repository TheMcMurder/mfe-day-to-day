# Aside

An `aside` element is usually more appropriate than the Markdown `blockquote`. This component should be used in those instances.

<Aside>Here is some relevant, tangential information.</Aside>
<Aside info>Here is some indirectly related to callout.</Aside>
<Aside warning>Here is a warning you should look at!</Aside>

</div>
