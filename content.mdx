# What is taking so long?

TL;DR It's all about the DX. Oh... And a CDN bug that AWS engineers can't figure out.

---

## So long - Migration - The dark times.

## So long - But the DX _now_ stinks (Empire Strikes Back)
- Goal is DX nirvanna. We're working on improvements to the current experience.
- Send us feedback (#ask-web-platform). We want to get it right.

---

## So long - CDN bug
- <Appear>For some reason `origin` header isn't being recieved by cloudfront in some cases</Appear>
- <Appear>We can prove that it's being sent</Appear>
- <Appear>AWS can prove that they aren't getting it</Appear>
- <Appear>Our latest change _should_ work around the issue.</Appear>
- <Appear>But we've thought that before...</Appear>

# MFE Misconceptions

---

## Misconception - Autonomy and alignment
- Not anarchy
- Not a mutually exclusive relationship
<Appear>
  <img src='https://miro.medium.com/max/1300/1*3PQHnnpNKsVAJhNts_GhPQ.png' className='mx-auto h-64'></img>
</Appear>

---

## Misconception - Standarization/Consistency and Flexibility

- <Appear>Standardization helps enable flexibility/autonomy</Appear>
- <Appear>MFE utilities (data-fetching, notification-service, etc) replace QS context and provide APIs to access data</Appear>
- <Appear>Hate the exposed APIs? Open an issue on it, propose a change, etc.</Appear>

## Misconception - Module federation

|  Â       | Module Federation   |  SystemJS                |
| ------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| format  | CommonJS only       | System.register prefered |
| registry| set/get             | set/get/import/delete/etc|
| build   | webpack/rollup      | webpack/rollup/others    |
| esm*    | CJS features only   | Supports ESM features    |

<p className='text-xs pt-4'><span className='text-red-500'>*</span> referring to module format supporting ESM features. IE live bindings</p>

---

## Misconception - Browser specifications

- Import maps are a browser specification that is actively being implemented
- SystemJS provides polyfills for browser specs: import-maps, module loading, and additional related specs.
- SystemJS also provides a module registery API. This functionality is extremely useful but not part of any browser specifications.
